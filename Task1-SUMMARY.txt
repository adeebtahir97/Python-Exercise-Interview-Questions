Description:
Task 1 is about assigning a session ID to each record in the clickStream dataset.
The distinctions in session ID should be observed when there is a duration of inactivity of 15 minutes.
I've used MD5hash to generate the SessionIDs


Techincalities:
Script Execution Time:
5.7 seconds

Data Structures Used:
Three Lists are used,
1. A list to store the sessionIDs that will later be assigned to the 'sessionID' column in the dataset
2. A list to store the clicked_epochs. This is used for testing the 15 minute inactivity window condition
3. A list to store the unique session IDs 

Time Complexity:
Since a session ID is being assigned to every record, the time complexity just depends on the number of records(N)
i.e T-> O(N) where N->Number of records

Space Complexity:
Three lists all depending on the number of sessions,
i.e T->O(N) at worst case (if each record has a different uuid)


Visualizations:
No Visualizations used.
